# CheckersAi
A working checkers game alongside an AI using min-max and alpha-beta pruning to play.
(Sorry for awful UI, no time was put into making it look pretty - used purely for ease of changing settings)

Select 'Single Player' in order to play against the minMax ai, the difficulty is how many turns ahead the ai looks.
